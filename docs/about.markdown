# Building a Todo List Application with Express, React, and MongoDB

In this tutorial, we will create a simple Todo List application using Express.js for the backend, React for the frontend, and MongoDB as the database. We will document each step thoroughly with explanations and include screenshots to guide you through the process.

## Part 1: Setting Up the Backend with Express and MongoDB

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project Structure

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

### Step 2: Installing Dependencies

Install Express.js and Mongoose (MongoDB object modeling tool).

### Step 3: Setting Up Express Server

Create a file named `server.js` and set up a basic Express server.

### Step 4: Connecting to MongoDB

Create a MongoDB Atlas account and obtain your MongoDB connection string.

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your MongoDB connection string.

Update `server.js` to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.

### Step 5: Creating Todo Model

Create a folder named `models` and inside it, create a file `todo.js`.

Define the Todo model schema with task and completed fields.

### Step 6: Testing the Backend

![Testing the Backend]()

Add a route to handle GET requests for fetching todos.

Start your server and test the route using Postman or curl.
